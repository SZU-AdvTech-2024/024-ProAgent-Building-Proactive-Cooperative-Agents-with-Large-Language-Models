I am playing an Overcooked-like game, you will help me explain why I failed on my actions. Follow the pattern.
Game rules:
- Legal actions include:
    - pickup_onion
        - I must have nothing in hand.
    - pickup_dish
        - I need to have nothing in hand.
    - place_obj_on_counter
        - I need to have something in hand.
    - wait(1)
        - wait for one timestep. 
- Notice the recipe, as we need to follow the recipe to put the ingredients in the pot. In this case, three onions. 
- The pot will cook for 20 timesteps and then become soup ready.
- We should start prepare for the next soup when we are done with the current one.
- I can only hold one thing at a time. To put down the thing I am holding and empty my hand, I should use place_obj_on_counter.  
- When the soup is ready, I am holding something that is not a dish, I should use place_obj_on_counter to put it down.
- I can only pick up and hold one thing at a time.
